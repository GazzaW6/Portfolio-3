# Hangman

This is my version on the classic game, Hangman. It was coded using Python. The aim of the game is for players to guess the correct word whilst ensuring they don't make more than 6 mistakes. Every mistake the user makes will result in your 'man' being one step closer to meeting his end and being hung.

This game is ideal for anyone who is wanting to improve their spelling or who is looking to blow off steam and kill some time. It is suitable for people of all ages.



## Features

* The game features an intro that contains the name of the game as well as the rules on how to play. This is printed to the console when the game is played.
* Players are promted to input a letter into the imput space. If player input a number or a full word, they will be prompted to try again as this is invalid.
* The Hangman image will be displayed throughout the game and will display the different stages of the game, illustrating the amount of mistakes the player has made and how many mistakes they can still afford to make.

## Testing

The code was tested using a pep8 linter as provided by code institute. They following messages were recieved when the code was run through the tester:

68: E222 multiple spaces after operator
72: W605 invalid escape sequence '\|'
77: W291 trailing whitespace
78: W291 trailing whitespace
83: W291 trailing whitespace
84: W291 trailing whitespace
104: E501 line too long (81 > 79 characters)
121: W291 trailing whitespace
122: E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1
130: W605 invalid escape sequence '\ '
